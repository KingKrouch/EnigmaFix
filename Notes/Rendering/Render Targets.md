B8G8R8A8_UNORM 3440x1440 buffer that has hardcoded 1920x1080 viewport width/height and right/bottom scissor rect.
I suspect that this possibly could be the render target that is giving us issues on the pause menu.
There are two of them that do similar things, after the draw-calls for the odd number rendering stuff is finished.

Looking at the Execution State of the DrawIndexed call shows us this:

This actually echos what was mentioned earlier, but wait, there's more! If you look at the Vertex Buffer inside of the inputs section, it shows something truly shocking ðŸ˜²

This seemingly goes on for a while for some reason (It's into the thousands count for the index). This might actually be the culprit behind the cropped camera transitions.
