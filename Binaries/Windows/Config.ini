[Resolution]
// "UseCustomResolution" is disabled by default, as UI scaling and positioning hasn't been figured out completely.
// Once it's eventually figured out, the in-game "4K Native" option will be replaced with a "Custom" option.
// "FullResolutionPostProcessing" will be usable once full res AO and other effects can be figured out.
// The option to have resolution scaling is being considered, if I can somehow find a way to decouple the rendering resolution of 2D elements from 3D elements.

[FieldOfView]

[Framerate]

// You can also change the "syncInterval" variable to cut down the refresh rate by fractions.
