![Logo](Resources/EnigmaFix_Logo.png)

### A mod that aims to improve several aspects of the PC versions for games in the Death end re;Quest series.*
#### * Support is also planned for MegaDimension Neptunia VIIR, Neptunia Virtual Stars, Dragon Star Varnir, and Mary Skelter 2.
![BuildStatus](https://github.com/KingKrouch/EnigmaFix/actions/workflows/cmake.yml/badge.svg?branch=main/)

**Key Features:**
* Uncapped framerates above or below 60 FPS *(Including VSync options, and fixes for framerate dependent gameplay logic)*
* Support for arbitrary resolutions and aspect ratios *(Including 16:10 and Ultrawide support)*
* Field of View customization *(While still retaining the intended FOV for in-game cutscenes)*
* Improved graphics, post-processing, and scalability options
* The option to skip opening videos
* In-Game UI to adjust options *(Can be accessed at any time using the **"DELETE"** key)*
* In-Game UI for developer logs *(Can be accessed using **"~/TILDE"**)*

## Compiling (For Programmers):
**NOTE:** Debugging through WINE is currently not available. This is something that needs to be resolved soon.

### Setup requirements:
* [CMake](https://cmake.org/)
* [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org/)
* [MinGW-w64 _(preferably with a full setup)_](https://www.mingw-w64.org/)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [Boost C++ Libraries (If using MSYS2, follow the Arch Linux process below)](https://www.boost.org/)

If you are using Ubuntu WSL, you can install the required dependencies using:

`sudo apt install git cmake ninja-build meson mingw-w64\* g++ gcc build-essential gdb libboost-all-dev libzydis-dev zydis-tools -y`

For Fedora, the process would be:

`sudo dnf install git cmake ninja-build meson mingw64-\* g++ gcc boost zydis zydis-devel zydis-doc zydis-tools gdb -y`

For Arch Linux, the process should be:

`sudo pacman -S ninja cmake meson gcc mingw-w64-toolchain boost zydis gdb --noconfirm`

**NOTE:** If you remove "sudo", the Arch Linux instructions should also apply to MSYS2.

**NOTE:** For NixOS, you shouldn't need any extra dependencies. Follow the build instructions.

### Recommendations:
* [JetBrains CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/) *(You can also use [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) to edit and compile the source code, assuming you install it with the C++ CMake tools for Windows component)*
* [Windows Subsystem for Linux _(If using Windows)_](https://ubuntu.com/wsl)
* [MSYS2 _(If using Windows)_](https://www.msys2.org)

**NOTE:** If compiling through Visual Studio, you might need to [install the Boost C++ libraries separately](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_73_0/more/getting_started/windows.html#install-boost-build).

Also, you might need to run ``vcpkg install zydis`` to install the Zydis library.

### Setup Instructions:
Assuming you have the development environment set up, you can follow these steps to compile the project:
1. `git clone https://github.com/KingKrouch/EnigmaFix --recursive`
2. `cd ./EnigmaFix`
3. Run either `./Build_Debug.sh` or `./Build_Release.sh` _(depending on what build type you want)_

**NOTE:** If you are using NixOS, you can follow along with these instructions or run this command ``NIXPKGS_ALLOW_UNSUPPORTED_SYSTEM=1 nix-build --arg buildType '"Debug"'`` to build a debug release. If you want to compile a release build, just replace ``"Debug"`` with ``"Release"``.

**NOTE:** *If you have trouble running the build scripts, running `sudo chmod +x ./Build_Debug.sh && sudo chmod +x ./Build_Release.sh` should fix the problem.*
<br><br>**VS USERS:** If you are using Visual Studio:
1. Open the project file as a directory
2. Press the "Switch between solutions and available views" button in the Solution Explorer, and then double-click the "CMake Targets View".
3. Build the project by right-clicking "EnigmaFix Project" and then by clicking "Build All".

## Installation Instructions:
Copy the "Resources" folder and dinput8.dll into the **"\resource\bin\"** directory of where the game is installed.

**Note:** *If you don't have any other Steam library locations set up, this will likely be "**C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\Common\Death end reQuest**".*

### Linux, Steam Deck, and Proton Compatibility Notice:
Add ``WINEDLLOVERRIDES="dinput8=n,b" %command%`` to the Steam launch options after following the installation instructions:

![Proton_Instructions](Resources/Proton_Instructions.png)

## System Requirements
* A *Legitimate* fully updated copy of the game from Steam or GOG (**I refuse** to provide technical support for pirated warez/scene cracked releases).<br />
